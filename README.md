# Udacity's Introduction to Tensorflow Lite - TFLite for Android
This program was developed as a part of Udacity Course.

The app classifies camera image as rock, paper, scissor. 

# TensorflowLite

TensorFlow Lite is an open source deep learning framework for on-device inference. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite

TFLite-Model directory has the jupyter-notebook with program to train and convert the model into tflite. Download tflite model and labels.txt (labels used in training) file. Copy the model and lable file into assests folder of the application.  

# Result 
The model calssify rock and paper correctly almost 100% of time. Struggles to identify scissors.
